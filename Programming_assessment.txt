Programming assessment: 11/1/22




Now look at APIs - search for a genomic position using an api then checks whether there is a pseudogene or sequence duplication elsewhere in the genome. Clinical scientists find that it would speed up their work when they interpret variants from NGS, rather than having to check manually.
* What pseudogenes/duplication (how are these defined to be queried in the programme)


Basic programme outline:
* insert either a genomic position or genomic interval, 
* then the program will check in the UCSC REST API sequence duplication track if that genomic position-interval has a sequence duplication in the genome, 
* and if it does, it will give back its genomic coordinates.


-input, bed file or genomic position as string
-dictionary of tracks/duplicates (duplication track to dictionary)
- list of duplicates and regions
-output is value from dictionary
1. Github repository (create_pseudo)
2. Api work out track
3. Upload duplicates txt and script to query UCSC database (sql file) onto github
4. API has .sql file (to modify database structures, file in github is specific for gr38) and .txt file for  putative duplicates 
5. Create a dictionary for duplicates (for all putative duplicates, are there more clinically significant duplicates to specific chromosomes to begin with e.g chr 22 due to highly homologous duplications? )
